/*
 Javascript based CSS element finders
 ____________________________________

 'sel' does a global search and
 finds any elements matched in
 the DOM and returns them as an
 array

 USAGE:
     sel("css_selectors");
 

 'rSel' works the same but finds
 elements related to an element
 either arbitrary or found from
 'sel' or other element finding
 javascript 'rSel' also the
 returns results as an array in
 the same way that 'sel' does

 USAGE:
     rSel(sel("css_selectors")[n], "css_selectors");
 OR  sel("css_selectors")[n].rSel("css_selectors");
 OR  rSel(element, "css_selectors");
 OR  element.rSel("css_selectors");
 OR  element.rSel("css_selectors")[n].rSel("css_selectors");
