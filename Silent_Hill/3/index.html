<p>Shakespeare Anthology 1:
	I'm not much for sentimental slop like "Romeo and Juliet"

Shakespeare Anthology 2:
	"King Lear" is in this one. I've never read that.

Shakespeare Anthology 3:
	One line from "Macbeth" that i just can't forget:
		Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player.
		 That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
		 and then is heard no more.

Shakespeare Anthology 4:
	"Hamlet" is in this one. I've never read that.

Shakespeare Anthology 5:
	"Othello" is in this one. I must've read it,
	but i forgot what happens.

Door note related to book order:
	In here is a tragedy ---
	art thou player or audience?
	Be as it may, the end doth remain:
	all go on only toward death.

	The first words at thy left hand:
	a false lunacy, a madly dancing man.
	Hearing unhearable words, drawn
	to a beloved's grave --- and there,
	mayhap, true madness at last.

	As did this one, playing at death,
	find true death at the last.
	Killing a nameless lover, she
	pierced a heart rent by sorrow.

	Doth lie invite truth?
	Doth verity but wear the
	mask of falsehood?
	Ah, thou pitiful, thou
	miserable ones!

	Still amidst the lies, though the end
	cometh not wherefore yearn
	for death?
	Wilt thou attend to thy beloved?
	Truths and lies, life and death:
	a game of turning white to black
	and black to white.

	Is not a silence brimming with
	love more precious than flattery?
	A peaceful slumber preferred to
	a throne besmirched with blood?

	One vengeful man
	spilled blood for two;
	Two youths shed tears for three;
	Three witches disappeared thusly;
	And only the four keys remain.

	Ah, but verily...
	In here is a tragedy---
	art thou player or audience?
	There is nothing which cannot
	become a puppet of fate or an
	onlooker, peering into the cage.
