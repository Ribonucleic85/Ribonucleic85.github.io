Meltan and Melmetal are Gen 7 this was confirmed through data mining of Sword and Shield the link (below) to information from a data mine shows where this is confirmed, it says "Galar Dex: Foreign" which means it is not of Galar origin or put another way is not Gen 8, so due to this i am adjusting the dex code to reflect
